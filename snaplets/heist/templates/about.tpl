    <p class="content-p">
    I am a second year studying Math and Computer Science at the University of Chicago. Programming-wise, I enjoy Haskell, Python, Ruby these days (mostly Haskell). For web programming, I like LiveScript, a nice functionalish language that compiles to Javascript.

    This blog will feature writeups of whatever projects I happen to be working on, including but not limited to programming, film, and prose(?).
